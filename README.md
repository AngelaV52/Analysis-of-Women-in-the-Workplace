# Analysis-of-Women-in-the-Workplace
Used R to visualize GitHub dataset and analyze with regression and classification models

GOAL:
Group 5 was interested in learning about women in the workplace (wage gap, number of men versus women in specific careers, how to make companies more female-friendly). We wanted to understand how different variables contribute to the wage gap, as well as how the wage gap differs between professions. 

CONCLUSIONS:
Our initial insight into the data tells us that there is a huge wage gap between the average earnings of men and women. 
This is proved by the fact that when looking at the distribution of earnings, the top half of data points are nearly all men, while the bottom half of data points are almost exclusively women;
Men get paid more than women in every category;
Men overwhelmingly work in blue collar and labor intensive jobs (construction) as well as science;
Women overwhelmingly work in business, community service, healthcare, sales and office, and service;
Over the years, the percentage of women in business is decreasing, and the percent in service industries is increasing;
Companies with more equal wage distributions between men and women tend to have more female employees

BUSINESS REALITY:
We want to educate people on the prevalence of the disparity of wages between males and females. This information can increase corporate awareness about the difference in wages, as well as educate people in their everyday lives. Overall, we see that the number of women in a company and the amount that they earn (in ratio form) are interrelated. We want companies to view our insights to consider how the representation of genders may affect the difference in earnings and vice versa. We also hope our insights can make companies aware of the lack of representation of one gender or the other in certain professions.
