# Analysis-of-Women-in-the-Workplace
Used R to visualize GitHub dataset and analyze with regression and classification models

GOAL:
Group 5 was interested in learning about women in the workplace (wage gap, number of men versus women in specific careers, 
how to make companies more female-friendly).

CONCLUSION:
Men get paid more than women in every category;
Men overwhelmingly work in blue collar and labor intensive jobs (construction) as well as science;
Women overwhelmingly work in business, community service, healthcare, sales and office, and service;
Over the years, the percentage of women in business is decreasing, and the percent in service industries is increasing;
Our initial insight into the data tells us that there is a huge wage gap between the average earnings of men and women. 
This is proved by the fact that when looking at the distribution of earnings, the top half of data points are nearly all men, 
while the bottom half of data points are almost exclusively women;
Companies with more equal wage distributions between men and women tend to have more female employees
